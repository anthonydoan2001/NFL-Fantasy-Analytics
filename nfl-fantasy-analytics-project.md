# NFL Fantasy Analytics

## Project Overview

This project will create a data-driven NFL fantasy football platform that leverages advanced analytics for player performance prediction and team optimization. It will cater to the specific needs of NFL fantasy leagues, including different player positions, scoring rules, and league structures.

## Technology Stack

- Data Science: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: MySQL
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (backend), Recharts (frontend)
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook

## Key Components and Features

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Scrape NFL player and team statistics from reliable sources (e.g., NFL.com, Pro-Football-Reference)
   - Collect data on injuries, weather conditions, and other relevant factors
   - Clean and preprocess data, handling missing values and outliers

2. Player Performance Prediction Models
   - Develop separate models for different positions (QB, RB, WR/TE, K, DEF)
   - Use historical data to predict future performance
   - Incorporate factors like opponent strength, home/away games, and weather conditions

3. Fantasy Scoring System
   - Implement a flexible scoring system that can be customized for different league types
   - Include standard scoring and Points Per Reception (PPR) options

4. Team Optimization Algorithm
   - Develop an algorithm to suggest optimal lineups based on predicted player performances and league scoring rules
   - Implement features for handling bye weeks and injured players

5. User Interface
   - Dashboard with overview of user's team performance and league standings
   - Player search and comparison tools
   - Lineup optimization suggestions
   - Trade analysis feature

6. League Management System
   - Support for different league sizes and structures (e.g., redraft, keeper, dynasty)
   - Draft tool with real-time player recommendations
   - Waiver wire management

7. Advanced Analytics Features
   - Strength of schedule analysis
   - Player consistency metrics
   - Boom/bust potential indicators
   - Comparative player analysis

## Implementation Steps

1. Data Collection and Analysis
   - Create Python scripts to scrape and process NFL data
   - Use Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis
   - Develop and train machine learning models for each player position

2. Backend Development
   - Set up Node.js server with Express
   - Implement API endpoints for user management, team management, and analytics
   - Create database schema and models for players, teams, leagues, and user data

3. Frontend Development
   - Design and implement React components for various features
   - Create interactive dashboards using Recharts for data visualization
   - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop use

4. Integration and Testing
   - Combine frontend and backend components
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Conduct thorough testing of prediction models and optimization algorithms

5. Deployment and Maintenance
   - Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
   - Deploy application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)
   - Implement a weekly update script to refresh player data and predictions

## Key Files and Their Purposes

1. `scripts/data_collection.py`: Scrapes latest NFL player and team statistics
2. `scripts/weekly_update.py`: Updates player data and recalculates predictions weekly
3. `notebooks/qb_model.ipynb`: Develops and trains the quarterback prediction model
4. `backend/src/controllers/leagueController.js`: Manages league-related operations
5. `backend/src/utils/scoringSystem.js`: Implements various fantasy scoring systems
6. `frontend/src/components/LineupOptimizer.js`: Interface for the team optimization feature
7. `frontend/src/pages/PlayerComparison.js`: Tool for comparing player statistics and predictions

This NFL Fantasy Analytics project leverages your data science and web development skills to create a sophisticated fantasy football platform. It emphasizes predictive modeling and advanced statistics to give users a competitive edge in their fantasy leagues.
